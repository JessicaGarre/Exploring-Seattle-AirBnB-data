      "Here we give you some of our personal views.  First of all, your hosts Barbara and Michael have been residents of Seattle since 1980 and Queen Anne residents since 1985.  We are semi-retired, having originally worked in the travel industry. Your co-host Max is fully retired.   •WE LOVE QUEEN ANNE.  We live on the north-side of Upper Queen Hill (one of the seven hills surrounding downtown) - two blocks from Seattle Pacific University (SPU), facing Fremont and the Ship Canal.   •WHY QUEEN ANNE? - When you could choose from so many other neighborhoods including staying right in the middle of downtown.    THREE MAJOR POINTS TO CONSIDER  ONE - Queen Anne is one of the closest neighborhoods to downtown as well as to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, a major cultural center and sightseeing area.  TWO - Queen Anne has some of the most incredible view points in the city due to being located on a hill.  THREE - although you are in a major city, it does not have a hectic, busy city feeling.          1\n",

The park features a bathhouse and swimming beach that is patrolled by lifeguards during the summer. Madison Park residents work hard to make their neighborhood quiet, friendly, and relaxed. Their grassy park slopes down to a 400-foot beach, with cement steps on the north and a short sandy portion on the south near a tall apartment building. The beach includes a bathhouse with restrooms, bike rack, and well-placed benches for parents to keep an eye on the children. There are some quaint shopping and restaurants right across the street. Swings and play equipment, baby swings, climbing features, big tall trees, new and well-kept equipment, two tennis courts, large lawn area, sand swimming beach w/ lifeguard chairs, two benches, and big grassy slope to lounge on.

FAVORITE PLACES There's more to Seattle than the first Starbucks, Pike Place and the Space Needle, Seattle's has many other unique districts, so please ask about our local version of cool places. CHECK-IN  You're welcome to drop-off your luggage anytime. However, the suite may not be ready for check-in until 3pm the day of arrival.  CHECK-OUT Guests must check-out by 10am on the departure day established in their reservation.  However, feel free to leave your luggage in the common area to pick-up later that day.   If you need flexibility around the specified check-in or check-out times, let us know in advance and we will do our best to accommodate your request.                                                                                                                                                                                                             3\n",
      "1. Although the check in time is 7PM you can check in at any time you want. However if you want to check in earlier, please note that:  - You need to use garage door to get in. I'll get you the pin code. In that case, you will find a key on the dining table.  - Cleaning will be done by 5 to 7PM in case previous guests checked out on the same day. 2. Please note that sometimes I can't arrange cleaning service so drop the price significantly to make your stay plus cleaning fee less than or equal to normal rate. If you think the price is too low, please assume that it is one of the cases below. You may want to inquire first:  A. You check in a clean house but need to wash and dry sheets/pillow cases, vacuum and clean wherever you used.  B. You check in a messy home so you need to clean whatever you want to use but it's OK for you to leave without cleaning any.                                                                                                                                          3\n",

Parking on the street in my immediate area is free for two hours between 7AM and 6PM if you're able to find a spot. From 6PM to 7AM and on Sundays and holidays parking is free but again, challenging.

The thing I like the most is to hear and to share stories from people all over the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         21\n",

      "I am a physicist and a Calvinist.  I like to cook and go hiking. I believe I cook pretty well for my children and my wife like the food I cook.  I also like to think and solve math problems that is probably why I got a doctorate from an Ivy League University in Physics.  I do not talk much but am very easy going. I keep updating to make sure they are safe, comfortable and updated.  My wife is probably the person who meets you most of time.  She has many positive reviews on airbnb and she is outgoing and detail oriented -- she pays more attention on cleanliness and weather you are comfortable or not. She wants me to take care of this property so this is my new experience on airbnb but she still does the final inspection to make sure the units are clean and satisfactory.

      "Cherie and I are Seattle Natives with a taste for the world. We love LA, NY, MIA and all in between, but Seattle is our city. We are small business owners and thought Airbnb would be an interesting new venture at a less stressful pace.  We are very casual after business hours :) and a very social couple.  We enjoy meeting people from different cultures and love to entertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrez:  I have been blessed with opportunities to travel many places (or at least many places to us), love new experiences and seeing historic land marks. We take pride in our city's beauty, rich culture and past good or bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've worked for myself most of my life and love being creative . I enjoy graphic design, acting rapping, video production, editing, directing, ballin' and shot callin' (a little urban humor) LOL. I truly want to do everything. I was a volunteer fire fighter with the Seattle Fire Department, EMT and certified life guard. ( I told you I want to do everything)\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a lot of day activity and nightlife connections with the transportation company I manage, if you want to do a little exploring- we've got the hook up.  We like to let our guests determine if they want some private personal time while using our space or want the works with sight seeing suggestions and even the option of tagging along with us for some fun. (Warning it can get a little crazy with us, especially once the party bus gets rolling, lol ). It is very common to see buses coming or going from our property at various hours of the day and night.  You can book airport / train / bus pick ups and drop off'(email hidden), please enter airbnb as the referral to receive a discount.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are open to any and all guests as along as everyone is respectful and polite.  Your race, sexual preference or religion is respected as long as you extend the same respect. Our space has its own keyless entry so you're welcome to come and go as you please without worrying about disturbing the rest of the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hope to have you stay with us...check out our reviews and book a night!\\r\\n\\r\\nPS: THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL, WHATS IN THE PHOTOS IS IN THE HOUSE. \\r\\n\\r\\nPrez & Cherie\\r\\n     11\n",

We look forward to hearing from you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                9\n",
      "Becki (pictured with her dog Kofi) and Doug will be your hosts at Seattle Suites. We are a small family run business dedicated to providing the personal service and accommodations that will help you love Seattle as much as we do. If there is anything we can do to make your stay in Seattle a more pleasant one please feel free to ask. We check email and voicemail frequently and will follow up with you asap.  Becki started this business to have more time at home after years of international travel as a management consultant with Microsoft. We now enjoy personal travel with our younger children, especially to London to visit our older son and his family. We have learned first hand how important a comfortable bed, a kitchen, good location and personal service can be when traveling for business or pleasure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    9\n",
      "I'm Christine, the short term rentals manager for St. John's Apartments. I'll be your go-to gal for all questions on bookings. \\r\\n\\r\\nMark Chambers and Oda Egeland have owned St. John's since January 2005.  When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!\\r\\n\\r\\nA little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. I wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there! \\r\\n\\r\\nI've been pondering this nugget lately: \"trade your cleverness in for awe.\" Helps to look up at the sky; there's always something awe-inspiring going on up there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       8\n",

Late arrivals are hard on me and I may not be able to accommodate late arrivals as I have three jobs and need my beauty sleep :)\\r\\nI am an easy going person but don't let people get away with much if they are behaving badly..  NO SMOKING IN BUILDING / NO VAPING/ NO POT …you can do all these things in our Smoking area outside. I  am easily accessible if you need anything, I am happy to oblige most requests and strive to make every visitor a friend but I also will give you your space. I try to take Sundays off to rest and have time with my dog.\\r\\nI am also happy to  help you plan a fun day here in Seattle.  I even have a lonely planet guide to Seattle if you want to borrow it.

      "We are a Seattle family.  We love our home and consider it an oasis in the city.  It is so full of light and so convenient to everything.  I am an avid walker and love that I can walk to all the conveniences of a city and also be at the lake and in the arboretum or at volunteer park within minutes.  we love to cook and have built our new kitchen with the idea that we would be cooking and sharing laughs and meals in the kitchen most days during the week.   We hope you will take as good a care of our precious home as we do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

      "Hey folks,\\r\\n\\r\\nI am Katrina and I am a single lady truly enjoying life in Seattle, with my two cats and my close group of friends. I am a social worker so I tend to run pretty odd hours as far as being awake or not, that being said I love it and I love the youth I work with. I am totally in love with Seattle, been here two years, prior to that I was a Texan so I tend to have the southern hospitality down and love meeting new people and finding out their story. I also love baking and crafting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a guest, I am an explorer, so I am pretty hands off and easy. I like finding my own way around your city or neighborhood and am not often inside the place I am sleeping, except for to sleep and shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a host, since I love new people, I am happy to be as involved or not involved in your stay in Seattle as you would like. I can provide recommendations for food, local activities, and the best tourist spots to actually hit if its your first time in Seattle (the underground tour is SO great and The Space Needle is a rip-off, you can get a better postcard view from Kerry Park for free.) Also, with the love of baking/cooking, comes access to whatever is in my fridge or pantry at the time. Often this means homemade jams or peanut butter, something sweet, maybe leftovers from a meal, or the ready to go smoothie packs or breakfast sandwiches that I freeze and then grab as needed. I want you to enjoy your stay as much as possible, so please don't hesitate to let me know how much you do or don't want me to be involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

My work is about helping individuals and teams use micro-structures to help them build big successes.\\r\\nAs a host, I make space for my guests to do what they came here for and have a sanctuary in a quiet, clean, safe place to rest.  (I don't have a TV, and there is good wireless in the house.) I love to cook - if I'm cooking while you're here, you'll be invited to share.\\r\\nAs a traveler, I travel very light, as backpacking is my passion. I like to get to know a place as the locals live it and the quirky secrets that may not be in the guidebooks. I'd rather eat great street food, than tourist versions.\\r\\nI love to read good writing of any kind, although I still prefer print. I love live theater, music, art, dance, and fringe performance.\\r\\nMy word of the year is \"ease.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

We have hosted over 25 foreign exchange students in as many years, from a variety of countries. \\r\\nWe live within walking distance from Lake Washington and Seward Park, an urban wildlife sanctuary and the Audubon center and where love to walk or cycle. Going around the park from here is less than 4 miles RT; the park and lake and amazing neighborhood are why we live here.\\r\\nWe have stayed in a few Air BNBs and our favorite was in Oaxaca, Mexico!\\r\\n\\r\\nI love to garden and grow fresh herbs and veggies in season. Our yard is on a wildlife corridor, so you can expect to see birds and occasionally a raccoon hanging out in our Fig tree. Great Blue Herons perch in our trees and we even see Bald Eagles soaring above the lake. From our perch, the view of Andrew's Bay is like being in the San Juan Islands. Boaters love the safe harbor and it is a party all summer!\\r\\nWe are adventure travellers and have stayed in Air BNB in Oaxaca, Mexico as well as San Diego, NYC and Atlanta.

      "I travel often for work, but my airbnb travel is strictly fun. I love to travel to nearby destinations, and I will usually spend my time, eating, shopping, and wine sipping. I love to be in areas where there is a lot going on. I do have a small dog, and can travel with or with out her. Some of my favorite nearby spots I frequent are Leavenworth WA, Portland OR, and Vancouver BC. They make for quick weekend driving getaways. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a host, I may not always be in town during your stay as I do travel often for work. I am always able to be reached in a timely manner on my cell phone. I am happy to recommend forms of transportation during your stay, and places to eat or go out. I do live in my condo so it should be equipped with regular items you may need. I am happy to help with any items or things that may make your stay more convenient or comfortable.

We love living in Fremont because it is so close to the water and it is full of restaurants and fun spaces to check out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

      "Hello world! My name is Gabe and I am a recent graduate from the University of Oregon. I grew up in Portland, OR and currently split time between living in Portland and Europe for my job. As a host I love answering questions to give visitors a local perspective of Oregon. I work in music production for a company based in Paris. Outside of concerts/music I really just love anything that keeps me active or gets me outside, hence why I love the Pacific Northwest. I am looking forward to using Airbnb more as a guest and as a host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
